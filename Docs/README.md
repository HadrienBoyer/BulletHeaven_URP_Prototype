# Documentation — BulletHeaven_URP_Prototype

This `Docs/` folder contains developer-facing documentation for the project. Use these notes to quickly understand architecture, locate key scripts, and onboard new contributors.

- **Project overview:** This is a Unity prototype using URP, Input System and TextMeshPro. The project auto-generates many ScriptableObjects/prefabs/scenes at import (see `Assets/Scripts/Editor/ProjectAutoSetup.cs`).
- **Where to start:** Read `Docs/Scripts/README.md` to understand the code layout and then open the subpages for details (`Core.md`, `Gameplay.md`, `Services.md`, `Editor.md`).

Getting started

- Open the folder with Unity Hub and let the editor import packages (URP, Input System, TMP, Timeline).
- If needed, re-run the auto-setup: open `Assets/Scripts/Editor/ProjectAutoSetup.cs` and trigger the setup method (or reimport the project).

Conventions & quick notes

- Scripts live under `Assets/Scripts/` grouped by feature:
  - `Core` — configuration, definitions, save/load, utilities.
  - `Gameplay` — player/enemy logic, projectiles, spawners.
  - `Services` — cross-cutting services (economy, analytics, cosmetics, IAP).
  - `Editor` — editor-time utilities and setup.
- ScriptableObjects (`*.asset`) are stored in `Assets/Resources/ScriptableObjects/` and are (re)generated by the auto-setup on first import.

If you have questions or want a deeper walkthrough, open a discussion in the repo or leave a short TODO in `Docs/` to request additional docs.
